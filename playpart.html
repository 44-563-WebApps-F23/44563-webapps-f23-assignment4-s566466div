    <h5>Title: CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house</h5>
    <h4>Author: Ibsen </h4>
    <p class="Direction">[SCENE.â€”A big old-fashioned room in CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house. At the
        back folding-doors, which are standing open, lead to an ante-room.
        Three windows in the left-hand wall. In the middle of the opposite wall
        a platform has been erected. On this is a small table with two candles,
        a water-bottle and glass, and a bell. The room is lit by lamps placed
        between the windows. In the foreground on the left there is a table
        with candles and a chair. To the right is a door and some chairs
        standing near it. The room is nearly filled with a crowd of townspeople
        of all sorts, a few women and schoolboys being amongst them. People are
        still streaming in from the back, and the room is soon filled.]</p>
