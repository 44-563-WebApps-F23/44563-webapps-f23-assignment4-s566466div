    <h1>Divya acts in play</h1>
    <h2>A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen</h2>
    <p>
        In Act 1 of "A Doll's House," Nora is seen as a carefree and childlike wife, seemingly content with her role in the household. Her husband Torvald refers to her affectionately as his "little skylark" and praises her beauty and charm. However, beneath this facade of marital bliss, Nora is harboring a significant secret that will unravel as the play progresses, challenging the conventional norms of the time.
