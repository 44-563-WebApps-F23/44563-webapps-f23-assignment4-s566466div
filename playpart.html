    <h1>Divya "Acts in play"</h1>
    <h5>Title: CAPTAIN HORSTER'S house</h5>
    <h4>Author: Ibsen </h4>
    <p><b>1st Citizen.</b>Hullo, Lamstad! You here too?</p>

    <p><b>2nd Citizen.</b> I go to every public meeting, I do.</p>
        
    <p><b>3rd Citizen.</b> Brought your whistle too, I expect!</p>
        
    <p><b>2nd Citizen.</b> I should think so. Haven't you?</p>
        
    <p><b>3rd Citizen.</b> Rather! And old Evensen said he was going to bring a
        cow-horn, he did.</p>
        
    <p><b>2nd Citizen.</b> Good old Evensen!(Laughter among the crowd.)</p>
        
    <p><b>4th Citizen (coming up to them).</b> I say, tell me what is going on here
        tonight?</p>
        
    <p><b>2nd Citizen.</b> Dr. Stockmann is going to deliver an address attacking the
        Mayor.</p>
        
    <p><b>4th Citizen.</b> But the Mayor is his brother.</p> 
    <p><b>1st Citizen.</b> That doesn't matter; Dr. Stockmann's not the chap to be
    afraid.</p>

    <p><b>3rd Citizen.</b> But he is in the wrong; it said so in the “People’s
    Messenger.”</p>

    <p><b>2nd Citizen.</b> Yes, I expect he must be in the wrong this time, because neither
    the Householders’ Association nor the Citizens’ Club would lend him
    their hall for his meeting.</p>
